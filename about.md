My name is Bryce Villanueva and I will be a fourth-year student at the University of Central Florida. I am currently a Management Development Intern for the McMaster-Carr Supply Company for Summer 2021. When I'm at UCF, I do research under Dr. Kauffman and Dr. Bhattacharya at UCF's Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. 

I was born in Philippines, raised in Hong Kong, and have been living in the United States since 2011. This unique situation has exposed to me so many cultures growing up which has allowed me to learn so much from others and share my experiences.

I am personally very interested in computing and technology because I believe that it has enabled many powerful things such as allowing people to meet with others from around the world and helping people to reach their creative potential. I hope to contribute in the larger goal of improving everyone's lives with technology.

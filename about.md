My name is Bryce Villanueva and I am a second-year student at the University of Central Florida. I currently do research under Dr. Kauffman at UCF's Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering to develop a simple and accessible way to program nitinol wire.

I was born in Philippines, raised in Hong Kong, and have been living in the United States since 2011. This unique situation has exposed to me so many cultures growing up, but this does mean that I am only a U.S. Permanent Resident until I am able to get my citizenship (which is, hopefully, next year).

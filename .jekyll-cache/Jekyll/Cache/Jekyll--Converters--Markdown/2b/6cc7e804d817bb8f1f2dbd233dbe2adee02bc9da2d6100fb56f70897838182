MeetUps is an app designed to connect UCF students that want to meet up for studying, lunch, or whatever they are looking for. I came up with this idea after talking with people and reading posts on the UCF subreddit as many students are always looking for study groups or things to do on campus.</p>

<p>This app was an entry for the 2019 Modo Labs Ideathon at UCF.</p>

### About
<img src="/images/Care++/CPP2.jpg" alt="" class="image center">

 The Care++ device family is a series of medical products designed to improve the lives of the elderly by giving them freedom to live outside of a hospital or care facility. This would be done by giving caretakers and medical professionals the tools needed to monitor patients.

The image above is a picture of one of the three devices.

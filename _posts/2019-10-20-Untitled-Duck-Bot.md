### About

<img src="/images/UntitledDuck/UDB1.jpg" alt="" class="image center" width="50%">

The Untitled Duck Bot is a robot duck inspired by the video game "Untitled Goose Game" where a goose is controlled by the player to ruin the lives of the innocent townspeople. This project was an entry for HackFSU 2019.

It's usually best to build a project around one of the challenges or prompts that are unique to each hackathon. We decided to not go by any challenge and instead create something cool, ridiculous, and fun.

We were at a loss for what to create at first, but eventually someone brought up "Untitled Goose Game". The premise of "Untitled Goose Game" is simple: terrorize townfolk while completing objectives as a crafty goose. This inspiration combined with my love for ducks gave birth to the Untitled Duck Bot.

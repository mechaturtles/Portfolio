### About
<img src="/images/VitaminSEA/VS1.jpg" alt="" class="image left">
The Great Navel Orange race is a competition where first-year engineering students must build a boat or submarine to traverse a fountain.

My team decided to build a "submarine" or, more precisely, an underwater rover--to simplify the control system.

### Design
The control system was extremely simple. No programming was required at all.

We originally wanted to 3D print our chassis but the design failed and we only had a week and a half left. I decided to repurpose an Orlando Hospital mug and 3D print parts to attach to the final design.

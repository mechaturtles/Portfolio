### About
<img src="/images/MeetUps/MU7.png" alt="" class="image center" width="18%">

MeetUps is an app designed to connect UCF students that want to meet up for studying, lunch, or whatever they are looking for. I came up with this idea after talking with people and reading posts on the UCF subreddit as many students are always looking for study groups or things to do on campus.

This app was an entry for the 2019 Modo Labs Ideathon at UCF.

### Functionality

This is the initial screen. It's simple and invites the user to check out 3 screens to learn more about the app view MeetUps, and create MeetUps.

This is the "Rules" screen to make it clear what is acceptable usage of the app.

This is the "View MeetUps" screen which gives the users the ability to see what events are already posted which is sorted by category.

This is an example of what a MeetUp could look like.
